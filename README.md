## Introduction 🚀
Credit card approval is a crucial task for financial institutions to manage risk and maintain profitability. Predicting credit card approval accurately can help banks streamline their application process and make informed decisions. This project aims to build predictive models using both traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of credit card approval predictions.

## Dataset 📊
The dataset used for this project contains information about credit card applicants, including their income, age, credit score, employment status, and the corresponding credit card approval decision (approved or rejected). It is important to preprocess the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features before training the models.

## Methods 🛠️
Two approaches will be explored for this task:
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizing traditional machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
- **Deep Learning**: Implementing deep neural networks using frameworks like TensorFlow to capture complex patterns in the data.

## Results 📈
The performance of each model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall. Additionally, visualizations such as confusion matrices may be used to assess the models' performance.

## Usage 🧑‍💻
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Preprocess the dataset.
4. Train the machine learning and deep learning models.
5. Evaluate the performance of each model.
6. Make predictions on new credit card applications.
